The goal of this repo is to provide a TUI for configuring and managing
bitcoin node, p2poolv2 node, a lightning node and a P2Poolv2 share
marketplace.

The wireframes we are building are available on the https://github.com/p2poolv2/p2poolv2/wiki/P2Poolv2-Mining-TUI[p2poolv2 wiki].

Currently we don't have binary releases available. You can run the
tool locally using just.

`just run`
